## Addresses Used in 802.11 Communications

- Up to **4** different `MAC addresses` can be used in an `IEEE 802.11 frame`.

    - `Transmitter` & `Receiver` MAC addresses refer to the communication link between devices:

        - In a typical wireless communication, a `laptop` (`transmitter` = `TA`) may send a frame to a `Access Point` (`receiver` = `RA`) requesting access to the internet. 

    - `Source` & `Destination` MAC addresses refer to the origin and ultimate destination of the frame, respectively, regardless of the number of intermediate devices the frame passes through before reaching its final destination.

        - The `laptop` (`transmitter` = `TA`) is also the source of the frame that is requesting access to the internet (`source` = `SA`).
            - So, the laptop's MAC address would be the Source MAC address (SA) too: laptop-A (`transmitter = TA` & `source = SA`)

        - The `Destination` of the frame is the `Server` or `Website` the user wants to access. 
            - So, the server's MAC address in a far datacenter would be the `Destination MAC address (DA)`.

- `TA` = `laptop`
- `SA` = `laptop`
- `RA` = `Access Point (AP)`
- `DA` = `Web Server / URL / etc`

| **`CLIENT`**_(any WiFi client)_| `client`   | The MAC of any client in the whole WLAN (_`TA/RA/SA/DA`_)   | `wlan.addr == "client_MAC_Address" ` |
| **Transmitter MAC address**    | `TA`       | The MAC address of the device `transmitting` the frame.     | `wlan.ta == "TA_MAC_Address"`        |
| **Receiver MAC address**       | `RA`       | The MAC address of the device `receiving` the frame.        | `wlan.ra == "RA_MAC_Address"`        |

| **Destination MAC address**    | `DA`       | The MAC address of the device the frame is being `sent to`. | `wlan.da == "DA_MAC_Address"`        |

- You can filter for IPv4 Addresses too. 
- This filters are the same as other Wireshark profiles (ex. LAN/ETH-I filters)

## **Types** of `Networks` Used in `802.11 / WiFi`

- A wireless network is made up of several components including:

    - `BSS` - A group of wireless devices that communicate with each other. "The whole WLAN"
    - `BSSID` - The specific MAC Address of the AP that a wireless frame is associated with.
    - `SSID` - Name of a wireless network, usually in plaintext. 
    - `ESS` - A Network that connects multiple & different BSSs together.
    - `IBSS` - A type of BSS that allows wireless devices to connect to each other without the need of an access point.
    - `DS` - Aystem that distributes data across a wireless network.
    - `Mesh network` - A type of wireless network where each device acts as a relay.
    - `WDS` - A system that allows wireless devices to connect without a wired connection.

- _**Note:** It's also worth noting that the BSSID is not necessarily the same as the MAC address of the wireless NIC of the AP. The BSSID can be set manually to any unique value by the administrator of the wireless network._

    - **IMPORTANT:** Not all of the components mentioned are mandatory for a wifi network to function. 
    - **The `WiFi Core Components` that are required for a wifi network to function include `BSS`, `BSSID` & `SSID`.**

## Management Frames

- 802.11 `Management Frames` = `type = 0`
- Used to manage and control wireless networks. 
- Used by stations (STA) to join and leave a BSS 
- Typically sent at a lower data rate than regular data frames, and they are not acknowledged by the receiving device. 
- This allows them to be transmitted quickly and efficiently, without adding to network congestion. 
- These frames are used for various purposes such as:

    - `Association` & `Disassociation` - To connect and disconnect devices from a wireless network.
    - `Authentication` & `Deauthentication` - To verify the identity of devices attempting to connect to a wireless network.
    - `Beaconing` - To advertise the presence of a wireless network and provide information about its capabilities.
    - `Power management` - To control the power usage of wireless devices.
    - `Quality of Service (QoS)` - To prioritize different types of traffic on a wireless network.

- There is a total of **12** `802.11 Management Frames`:

## Control Frames

- 802.11 `Control Frames` = `type = 1` 
- Assist with the delivery of data frames 
- Used to control and manage the flow of data on a wireless network. 
- Typically sent at a lower data rate than regular data frames and they are acknowledged by the receiving device
- They help to ensure efficient and reliable communication on a wireless network. 
- These frames are used for various purposes such as:

    - `RTS` - `Request to Send` - Request from a device the access to the wireless medium and prevent collisions between devices.
    - `CTS` - `Clear to Send` - Clearance for a device to access to the wireless medium and prevent collisions between devices.
    - `ACK` - `Acknowledgment` - To confirm the receipt of data frames by the receiving device.
    - `Block ACK` - `Various ACKs` - To confirm the receipt of multiple data frames by the receiving device.
    - `PS-Poll` - `Power Save` - To conserve power on wireless devices by allowing them to sleep when not in use.
    - `CSA` - `Channel Switch Announcement` - To inform devices of an upcoming change in the channel being used by the wireless network.

- There is a total of **8** `802.11 Control Frames`:

## Data Frames

Wireless data frames are the frames used to transmit data on a wireless network. These frames are used to:

transmit data from one device to another
carry user data, such as web pages, emails, and files
Data frames are typically sent at a higher data rate than management or control frames and may be acknowledged or unacknowledged depending on the protocol used. They are essential for the actual communication on a wireless network, allowing devices to exchange information. They are typically larger in size than management or control frames as they carry the actual payload. The way data frames are handled, protected, and prioritized is a key factor in determining the overall performance and reliability of a wireless network.













## Radiotap Protocol

In Wireshark, the radiotap protocol allows to decode the contents of the radiotap header, which is a header added to frames in some wireless networks. This header contains information about the physical layer of the wireless communication, such as the signal strength, data rate, and channel frequency.

## 802.11 Retransmissions

- Retransmission is a process of resending a frame that was not successfully received by the destination. 
- Retransmission is used to ensure that packets are delivered reliably over wireless networks. 
- Retransmission is a normal and expected process in wireless networks, but excessive retransmission can indicate a problem. 
- Some common causes of excessive retransmission include:

## 802.11 Frames Encryption

- Encryption can be applied to all three types of wireless frames: control, data, and management. 
- However, whether a frame is encrypted or not depends on the specific wireless protocol being used, as well as the security settings of the network.

    - `Data Frames` - **`Usually encrypted`** to protect the confidentiality and integrity of the user data they carry. 
        - This is done to ensure that only authorized devices can access the data and that the data has not been tampered with during transmission.

    - `Control frames` - **`Generally NOT encrypted`**, as they are used to manage and control the flow of data on a wireless network, rather than carrying user data. 
        - However, some advanced wireless protocols may encrypt control frames for added security.

    - `Management frames` - **`typically NOT encrypted`**, as they are used for network management and maintenance, and do not carry user data. 
        - However, some advanced wireless protocols may encrypt management frames for added security.

- It's worth noting that encryption is not always implemented, it depends on the particular network, the security policy and the level of security desired.
- You can use Wireshark's filter function to filter for encrypted or unencrypted frames of different types. Here are some examples:



To filter for encrypted 802.11 frames: wlan.fc.protected == 1
To filter for non-encrypted 802.11 frames: wlan.fc.protected == 0
To filter for control frames: wlan.fc.type == 0
To filter for management frames: wlan.fc.type == 1
To filter for data frames: wlan.fc.type == 2



You can also combine multiple filters using "and" and "or" operators, for example:

To filter for encrypted management frames: wlan.fc.protected == 1 and wlan.fc.type == 1
To filter for non-encrypted control or management frames: wlan.fc.protected == 0 and (wlan.fc.type == 0 or wlan.fc.type == 1)
You can also use the "not" operator to filter for the opposite of a given filter.
